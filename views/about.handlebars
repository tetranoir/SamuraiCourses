			Samurai Courses tackles an interesting problem that's rather difficult to solve mentally -- the constraint satisfaction problem. Because its hard to juggle all combinations of schedules you may have, often times people will plan out whatever classes they can until something doesn't work. The draw back of this "try until it breaks" method is that you don't get a good overview of all possible iterations, so its hard to visualize and see which is best for you.

			Hopefully, by using this app, more options may open up to you when deciding which set of courses, discussions, labs, etc you want to use as your next quarter's schedule.
